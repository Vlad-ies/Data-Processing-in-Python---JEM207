# External Military Aid in Ukraine
The main purpose of this project is to find a correlation between external military aid and liberated territories and try to predict when the war will be over if there is a correlation. So, we are trying to answer two questions: Do the military aid from the US and the 9 countries of NATO help Ukraine to liberate Ukrainian territories? Is there a difference in military aid between these countries?
The answers to these questions are estimated in the file [External Military Aid in Ukraine]()
Our project consists of two parts:
1. For the first part we used data from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/2022-ukraine-russian-war). Two datasets show Russian losses as military equipment and as casualties. We visualized it and in addition, calculated how many equipment were destroyed and remaining for Russian side.
